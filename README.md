## Introduction
In the 21st century, various businesses, including gaming companies, are continuously releasing new products. Understanding consumer feedback is crucial for product improvement and development. This project focuses on sentiment analysis within the gaming industry, leveraging Python, its libraries, and Jupyter Notebook to perform web scraping for game reviews. The primary aim is to analyze public sentiment towards different games based on online reviews, employing data cleaning, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis techniques. Although the project initially targets the gaming industry, the methodology could be applied to other sectors or even public figures in the future.

## Goals
- Extract data from online sources and prepare it for analysis.
- Clean the data to improve processing efficiency and reduce memory usage.
- Perform sentiment analysis to gauge public sentiment towards various games.

## Installation
